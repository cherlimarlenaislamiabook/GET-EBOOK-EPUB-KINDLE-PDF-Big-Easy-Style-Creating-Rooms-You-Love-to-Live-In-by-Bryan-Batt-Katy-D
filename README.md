Big, Easy Style: Creating Rooms You Love to Live In by Bryan Batt,Katy Danos,Kerri McCaffety Book Review

Name: Ethel Mermaid
Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: Bryan Batt's Magnificent Style Manifesto
Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2011
Review: Big, Easy Style is a guidebook for creating unique environments of every dimension. A sitting room, a tiny hallway bath, a grand salon or a hallway, Bryan takes the reader step by step to take things we love and use them to their greatest visual impact. Even better, he shows us how to use them effectively, but without looking too studied.
The best lesson, and perhaps the main theme of Bryan's entire book, is to throw out the rules of decorating. Don't fear color, but embrace your favorites as neutral backdrops (even purple, orange or red) to showcase your favorite things. Your room won't decorate itself, but evolve as you start with a few key pieces and begin to build on them.
When Bryan tells stories about his charmed New Orleans childhood and love of diverse architectural styles, you can see that his experiences mirror our own: visiting Grandma's formal home and drinking in its personality, hanging out in his parents' more modern place, and strolling through the ornate French Quarter, perhaps thinking "If I lived there..."
Bryan has provided us with artistic photographs of rooms of many styles, and shown us how to use amazing finds like hanging Lucite bubble glass chairs, Louis IVX settees and artwork of every style. The seamless but casual way he integrates everything from suptuous antiques to attic treasures and thrift store lamps is an outstanding primer that any novice can enjoy and use to help find his or her own big, easy style.

Title: Be Yourself!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2014
Review: I love this book because he really emphasizes using your own taste & style to design your home. It completely changed my whole outlook on my new place & he made me feel confident to trust my judgment. I plan to use artwork that I've created on my own & do things that might not appeal to everyone, but will make me happy. The photos & designs are exquisite & even though the New Orleans flavor is opposite of my minimalist needs, his down to earth philosophy really spoke to me. Bryan Batt's motto is to be yourself & I have to say, I've applied this to how I dress and also to how I feel about life in general. I saw him on a PBS book show, not realizing that he was also an actor on Madmen. He was so interesting, not pretentious at all & I found that he was a truly wonderful person. I bought this book based on his interview & I was not let down. He let my mind wander & open up to new ideas & I am now thinking about using color in a whole new way. I am so excited about my place & I am more focused on exactly what I want. What a great influence!

Title: Bigger, Eazier STYLE!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2012
Review: I've have been reading and browsing through this colourful and awe inspiring book. Bryan's style and taste is unique and very inspiring to me. His style is very similar to mine. I like the very different period pieces he uses in a each room and weaves them together to create such a personal, bright and intimate space. His knowlegde on the implementation of color is spectacular and each room is jam packed full of exciting tips and designer ideas. Bryan knows what he wants to ultimately achieve in each interior space he decorates and inspires the homeowner, being YOU, who you are in your home and to be yourself - I love his direct, honest approach, and guess what........he is right! Love this book, great job Bryan Batt.

Title: Let the Good Times Roll!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2014
Review: It's hard for me not to love everything about New Orleans, and this book does a good job of capturing the eclectic charm of a city even a Cat 5 hurricane couldn't destroy. I purchased this book because the author was on the Nate Berkus show and made a drink that sounded divine. I mistakenly thought the book would also contain some great recipes. Alas, it is a book, and a good one, about decor, not food. You'll have to go elsewhere for that

Title: Not Traditional New Orleans, but Great Style
Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2013
Review: Although this book does not contain photos of traditional, grand LA homes, I do like some of Bryan Batt's decorating style. This book contains photos of entire rooms, which helps you understand his design philosophy. He gives rooms a very eclectic spin, and in his own home he uses items that were passed down through his family, for a very personalized effect. I highly recommend this book, but if you are into more of a minimalist look, you probably won't like it.

Title: No Fear of Color
Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2014
Review: Typically the front cover displays the best of a design book, but in this case the entire book was beautifully and tastefully photographed. One of the aspects of the book that I found most appealing was the "feel" of New Orleans in the design but with a more modern flair. The colors used were eye-catching and bold, and it is nice to see someone work with color and pattern as well as Mr. Batt. The writing was also fascinating as stories were shared about many of the items and their personal meaning to the author or the owners of the featured rooms. Will love this book for years to come!

Title: Worth reading.
Date: Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2016
Review: Entertaining reading with charming, occasionally witty writing. Batt is talented and modest. He has a laissez-faire attitude toward color and provenance, but there is some subtle discipline hiding in there, too. He had me at "What did color ever do to you?"

Title: a recipe for New Orleans style gumbo
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2012
Review: I love this book so much! New Orleans has a distinctive style unlike any other North American city. It's interiors are a fusion of French, Caribbean, Spanish, African and traditional Southern styles.

It may be the only city in America where the cool, fun, creative people still own antiques. If you like, or have inherited, antiques but don't want your house to look like Grandma's, this is an essential book (along with Southern Cosmopolitan).

Big, Easy Style is incredibly chic, but the writing is non-snobby New Orleans hospitality. Bravo.
